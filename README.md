# Data Analysis of Seoul Bike Demand

Currently Rental bikes are introduced in many urban cities for the enhancement of mobility comfort.    
<br>   

It is important to make the rental bike available and accessible to the public, as it provides many alternatives to commuters in metropolises.  There are a lot of **advantages** to bike rents, it is *convenient* because it permits people not to keep the bike all day long. Furthermore it is the *healthiest* way to travel and it has *environmental* benefits.  
Eventually, providing the city with a stable supply of rental bikes becomes a major concern. 
The crucial part is the prediction of bike count required at each hour for the stable supply of rental bikes.
The dataset contains weather information (Temperature, Humidity, Windspeed, Visibility, Dewpoint, Solar radiation, Snowfall, Rainfall), 
the number of bikes rented per hour and date information.  
<br>
Indeed, the main **problematic** faced is that bikes stations are not always well supplied.
